    <h1>Custom JS when Navigating</h1>

    <p class="lead">
        There are 4 main alternatives when it comes to running custom JS:
    <ol class="">
        <li>Listen to <code>pager.childManager</code> if you want to be notified whenever a navigation has happened.
            It is not recommended to try to stop the navigation at this point since it would involve changing the
            history.
        </li>
        <li>Bind to global <code>click</code> if you want to be notified when a navigation is about to happen and
            you want a chance to stop it. Just do not <code>return true;</code> in order to stop the navigation.
        </li>
        <li>Bind to local <code>click</code> if you want to control a certain navigation. This is probably what you
            want to do if you want to inject validation.
        </li>
        <li>Bind to local before/after show/hide if you just want to be notified about a navigation.
            Some custom bindings from other 3rd parties (e.g. Kendo UI) might be triggered after
            <code>afterShow</code>, since they put the processing of their bindings on the event queue (possible
            out of performance reasons).
            If you want your code to execute after their bindings are processed you either have to be able
            to jack into their bindings version of <code>afterShow</code> (if they got one)
            or put your code on the event queue too.
        </li>
    </ol>
