      			<h3 class="featured">The Problem</h3>
      			<p>If you are involved in the UX design process you can relate to this story; you've spent months in meetings, countless wireframes, comps, spreadsheets full of requirements, content documents, etcetera. </p>
      			<p>Now the project is in the hands of developer, armed with the documentation you painstakingly took a lot of time to prepare and throw over the wall. The developer, just into the project, has to distill a diversity of "deliverables" and conclude with the same picture, form and function the UX people had in mind.</p>
      			<p>Much to your dismay, the developer hardly reads any of the documentation and with an onslaught of meetings, you now have to reinvest in the project time to catch "defects" which ultimately are labeled "enhancements" by dev and out your project goes into production looking very different than what was designed.</p>
      			<p>Sound familiar?<p>
			</div>
			<div class="da7-da12 tb5-tb8 mb-all white-text">
      			<h3 class="featured">The Solution</h3>
      			<p>Sherpa is about simplifying the typical plethora of UX deliverables into a homogeneous design ecosystem that provides a singular point of focus for business, design and development to communicate and agree.</p> 
      			<p>Sherpa was built and maintained by UX people colaborating with business people and developers. It is built to fill the needs of the UX, business and development communities equaly and usher a process that is focused on velocity, accuracy and reuse.</p>
      			<p>Sherpa is built using open source technologies such as Twitter Boostrap, Knockout.js, underscore.js and many more. It is highly configurable and open source itself so you can also customize to your needs. Sherpa continues to evolve with one goal in mind, provide the best way to prototype web designs.</p>
